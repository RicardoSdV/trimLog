CompressionFormatList inherits from list with two extra attrs:
    - cnt: Which holds the number of repetitions of itself it represents
    - rep: A string represents the type of data the list holds for easy formatting after compression

compress() algo receives an uncompressed CompressionFormatList and recursively compresses it, producing a nested
CompressionFormatList in such way:

Pass 0: [A, A, A, A, B, A, A, B, C] is a CompressionFormatList of strs
Pass 1: [A, A, A, A, B, A, A, B, C] group_size is 4, bc len = 9 & 9 // 2 = 4 so nothing happens bc no groups found
Pass 2: [A, A, [A, A, B], C] group_size -= 1 so is 3, one group is found it is compressed
Pass 3: [A, A, [[A] B], C] the group found in the previous stage compressed recursively
Pass 4: [A, A, [[A] B], C] Recursion finished, we're back, group size is 2, no groups found
Pass 4: [[A], [[A], B], C] Finally group size 1 another group found

The cnts:
    result.cnt = 1
    result[0].cnt = 2
    result[1].cnt = 2
    result[1][0].cnt = 2
    result[2].cnt = AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'cnt'


Known problems:

    - It will always prefer longer patterns over short ones, for example:
    A, A, A, A, A, A
    Will be compressed into:
    2, 3A
    Which does make sense because its two groups of three As, but it's not a readable way of compressing logs.

    The further problem is that the only other algo I could come up with does exactly the same thing
    but prefers always the shorter pattern.

    Solution:
        - Do a second pass and try to remove such
